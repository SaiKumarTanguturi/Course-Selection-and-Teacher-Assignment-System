When the user first opens the dashboard, they are greeted with a clean and intuitive interface that presents a brief problem statement outlining the purpose of the dashboard. Below the problem statement, a button labeled "Solution" is available. Upon clicking this button, the dashboard displays three distinct login options: Student Login, Faculty Login, and Administration Login.

1. Student Login:
If the user selects the Student Login, they are guided through a process where they can:

Select Courses: The student can choose from a list of available courses in which they are enrolled.
View Associated Faculties: Once the course is selected, the dashboard displays the names of the faculty members associated with those courses.
Provide Feedback: The student can then give feedback for each faculty member, evaluating aspects such as teaching style, course materials, and overall experience.
2. Faculty Login:
If the user chooses the Faculty Login, the dashboard requests the faculty memberâ€™s registration number for verification. Once verified, the faculty member is directed to a page where they can:
Enter Student Redgistration Number like 22091A05D6 upto 22091A05D25.
Assign Marks: Faculty can assign marks to students based on their performance in the respective courses. The process is simple and allows the faculty member to select a course, choose the students from that course, and input the marks accordingly.
3. Administration Login:
The Administration Login can provide various management-level features such as overseeing both students' and faculty activities, managing course data, and accessing reports. This section may also include options for auditing feedback and monitoring overall performance metrics.
